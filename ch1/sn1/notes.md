# Chapter 1, Section 1: The Elements of Programming
Text begins on page 4.

> We are about to study a *computational process*. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called *data*. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a *program*. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
* programming language = symbolic expression of a program's structure composed of instructions
* bug/glitch = error in programming (syntax, logic, intermittent)
* debugging = fixing bugs in a program
* Lisp = LISt Processing. Invented by John McCarthy in 1958
* interpreter = machine that carries out instructions and processes
* Lisp is the second-oldest programming language in use today after Fortran
