# Chapter 1, Section 3: Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures (p. 56)

Procedures are simply generalized abstractions of compound operations on inputs
independent of the inputs themselves. They define the methods for finding
outputs, not the outputs themselves. Abstracting away details of computation
allows for clarity, precision, and efficiency. By abstracting away the details
of a procedure by manipulating it as data, we create **higher-order
procedures** that can pass procedures as inputs or outputs. This is because in
Scheme, procedures are **first-class citizens** that have all the rights of any
other data type.
