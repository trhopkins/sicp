# The Wizard Book
*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* is a textbook written by Harold Abelman and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman in 1985, and revised in 1996. The goal of this project is to incrementally solve every problem in the book and host my notes/solutions here. Along the way, I intend to learn a bit of Scheme, learn a bit of Git, and become a better programmer.
