# The Wizard Book

*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* is a textbook written by
Harold Abelman and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman in 1986. The goal of
this project is to incrementally solve every problem in the book and host my
notes and solutions here. Along the way, I intend to learn a bit of Scheme,
learn a bit of Git, and become a better programmer.

## TODO

This is not an exhaustive list, and is subject to change. I have no schedule
for completing the exercises in SICP at the moment. If it stops being fun, I
will probably stop updating this repository.
