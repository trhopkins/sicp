# The Wizard Book

*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* is a textbook written by
Harold Abelman and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman in 1986, and
rereleased in 1996. The goal of this project is to incrementally solve every
problem in the book and host my notes and solutions here.

## TODO

This is not an exhaustive list, and is subject to change. I have no schedule
for completing the exercises in SICP at the moment. If it stops being fun, I
will probably stop updating this repository.
