# The Wizard Book
*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* is a textbook written by Harold Abelman and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. The goal of this project is to incrementally solve every problem in the book and host my notes and solutions here. Along the way, I intend to learn a bit of Scheme, learn a bit of Git, and become a better programmer.

## TODO
This is not an exhaustive list, and is subject to change. I have no schedule for completing the exercises in SICP at the moment, it's just for fun. If it stops being fun, I will probably stop updating this repository.
1. Read chapter 1
2. Read chapter 2
3. Read chapter 3
4. Read chapter 4
5. Read chapter 5

Other considerations:
* Learn Racket with DrRacket
* Read The Little Schemer
* Read The Scheme Programming Language
* Finish the Spring 2021 semester before dedicating more time to this repository

## Resources
The resources compiled here are a good jumping-off point for learning Scheme and following the curriculum around SICP.
